        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Competent and hardworking, works well in collaborative partnerships that can match my high level of motivation and drive.
        <br>I'm a pragmatic introvert with a dark sense of humor and a love of rich colors. 
        <br>Coming from a difficult past has given me a no-nonsense attitude mixed with a streak of 'let's see what happens.'
        <br>I enjoy tackling challenges and prefer to work on short term projects (under 1 year) over long term projects. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the past 10 years, my jack-of-all-trades career path has recently come together in a highly effective meld of skills. 
        <br>In my day-to-day, I strive to leave room for continuing education and to practice kindness towards others. 
        <br>Passionate about equality, I pursue a mindset of open-mindedness and self reflection. 
        <br>I love bringing people together to accomplish a goal and developed many highly effective group facilitating strategies.
